##  Quiz 8
### Part 1
I was inspired by the IoL Imitation Of Life created by IOL Imitation Of Life.By growing ancient organic shapes that mimic life, IOL explores deep philosophical questions that arise from contemplating the ontological limits of representation, the elusive nature of existence, and the mysterious nature of existence in the vastness of the universe.

The project is a collaboration between Serial Cut and artist Frederic Kokott. Three series of animations were produced, titled "Imitating Life", exploring the past, present and future. One of my main inspirations was the future part.I think the use of color and shapes full of randomness can be incorporated into my projects.

Going through these code sets will help me get a handle on how to program out random color fills and randomly generated shapes.

With these codes it can help me understand how to make completely random lines, which can simulate the look of random life derivation.
